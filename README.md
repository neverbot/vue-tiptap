Example of using [tiptap 2](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap/) as a Vue 3 component without being completely renderless, so you can see how to use it inside your own components or even use it right away. It can be imported as a Vue 3 component, and you can see in the `example` directory how it would be used inside your application.

**Note**: now tiptap has their own examples and components for different frameworks (including vue 2 and vue 3), so maybe you should take a look to the official package [@tiptap/vue-3](https://tiptap.dev/installation/vue3). This package will not be updated anymore.
